# Soccer League Database Project

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation and management of a soccer league database using MySQL. The database is designed to store information about teams, players, coaches, matches, seasons, stadiums, leagues, sponsors, positions, performance statistics, injuries, and contracts. The database is normalized to the Third Normal Form (3NF) to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity.
